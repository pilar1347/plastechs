The Plastechs are a group of Lady Software Engineers living the dream and coding circles around the tech bros. On Wednesdays we wear pink, but we kick ass everyday. Get in loser, we're going coding.

For real though, we are here to contribute our knowledge to the software development community and to talk a little about what it's like to work in such a male-dominated industry. If we inspire some bitches along the way, great. That would be SO fetch.
