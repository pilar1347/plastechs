## Here is our blog!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pilar1347/plastechs/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Posts

To create a post, name it following this convention: `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` and save it in the `_posts` folder. Jekyll will handle the rest.

### Jekyll Themes

I set up a basic Jekyll theme, but we can choose another or customize it.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pilar1347/plastechs/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
